Dear Gregory,

Thank you for your e-mail, it would be a pleasure to provide you with further information on our products. You are welcome to discuss this project by phone but in first instance I would like to clarify your requirements and provide you with further information on the model(s) I think will be suitable.

80kg of tissue per week is a relatively small amount of waste, the material itself is easily combustible in a standard medical incinerator. We have supplied many of our medical incinerators to surrounding countries such as Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Guatemala and Mexico as UK made incinerators are seen as a global standard of quality.

I would recommend our i8-10S Incinerator, this model has a burn rate up to 20kg per hour and a compact footprint, gases are re-burned in the secondary chamber to eradicate smoke, odours and harmful emissions providing a clean incineration process. Incineration will allow waste to be destroyed at the source, removing the risk of cross-contamination and preventing potential spread of diseases or other environmental harm caused by chemical leakages.

I have attached the brochure for the i8-10S to this e-mail for further details, if you would like to receive pricing information please confirm the following:

Type of fuel? i.e. Gas or Diesel
Is a shelter required?
Preferred seaport for delivery?
Any special requirements?
I look forward to hearing from you.
